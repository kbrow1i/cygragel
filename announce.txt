Subject: ragel 7.0.0.11-3

The following packages have been uploaded to the Cygwin distribution:

* ragel-7.0.0.11-3
* libragel0-7.0.0.11-3
* libragel-devel-7.0.0.11-3

Ragel compiles executable finite state machines from regular
languages.  Ragel targets C, C++, and ASM.  Ragel state machines can
not only recognize byte sequences as regular expression machines do,
but can also execute code at arbitrary points in the recognition of a
regular language.  Code embedding is done using inline operators that
do not disrupt the regular language syntax.

This is a rebuild of the 7.0.0.11-2 packages, with an upstream patch
to fix a build problem.
